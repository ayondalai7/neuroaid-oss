    "assistant": "I’m sorry you’re dealing with a headache.  \nHere are a few quick steps you can try right now:\n\n**Grounding (1–2 minutes)**  \n1. Sit or lie down in a quiet spot.  \n2. Close your eyes and take three slow breaths: inhale for 4 counts, hold for 2, exhale for 6.  \n3. Notice the sensations in your body—where the tension is, what feels relaxed.  \n4. If your mind drifts, gently bring it back to the breath.\n\n**CBT Reframe**  \n- *Automatic thought:* “This headache is ruining my day.”  \n- *Evidence:* You’re still able to read this message and reach out.  \n- *Balanced thought:* “I’m experiencing discomfort, but I can take small steps to feel better.”\n\n**Reflective Prompt**  \nWrite a brief note:  \n- What was the last thing you ate or drank?  \n- How much sleep did you get last night?  \n- Did you notice any stressors today?  \n- What small action could you take now to ease the pain?\n\n**Actionable Steps**  \n1. **Hydrate** – sip water or a calming herbal tea.  \n2. **Rest** – close your eyes for 5–10 minutes or take a short walk if you feel up to it.  \n3. **Environment** – dim the lights, lower the volume, or use a cool compress on your forehead.  \n4. **Medication** – if you have an OTC pain reliever and it’s safe for you, consider taking it as directed.\n\nIf the headache persists, worsens, or is accompanied by other symptoms, please consider contacting a healthcare professional. You’re not alone—small, intentional actions can help shift the experience.",

Take a deep breath in for 4 counts, hold for 2, exhale for 6.  \n2. Notice the sensation of your feet on the floor or the chair beneath you.  \n3. Name three things you can see, two you can touch, and one you can hear.\n\n**CBT reframing**  \n- Identify the thought that’s making you unhappy (e.g., “I’m a failure”).  \n- Ask: “What evidence supports this? What evidence contradicts it?”  \n- Replace it with a balanced thought: “I’m having a tough day, but I’ve handled challenges before.”\n\n**Reflective journaling prompt**  \nWrite a brief note:  \n- What happened today that contributed to this feeling?  \n- What small action could you take tomorrow to shift your mood?  \n- One thing you’re grateful for, no matter how small.\n\nTake it one step at a time.
